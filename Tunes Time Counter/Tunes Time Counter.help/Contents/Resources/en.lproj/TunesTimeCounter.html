		<h2>The Basics</h2>
		<p>
			The application will read all of your iTunes library and tell you how
			much time you‚Äôve spent listening to each track in the library. Under
			the hood, a simple multiplication is taking place for each of your
			tracks: the length of the track times the number of times you‚Äôve
			listened to it. Pretty simple, no?<br/>
			You‚Äôll also get the total time spent listening to music! This time we
			use the addition operator. It is very powerful and gives exactly the
			value we seek.
		</p>
		<p>
			‚ö†Ô∏è The app <b>requires</b> iTunes to be launched for the app to work.
			If you try and launch the app when iTunes is not launched, don‚Äôt
			panick though. You‚Äôll get a very informative error message informing
			you to launch iTunes and try again. (You can click the little arrow at
			the bottom-left of the main window to try again.)<br/>
			This happens because Tunes Time Counter uses a technology called Apple
			Events to read your library. This technology requires the destination
			application to be launched in order to function.
		</p>
		<h2>iTunes and Apple Music</h2>
		<p>
			A question you could ask: I have subscribed to Apple Music. Will this
			app tell me the time I spent listening tracks that are not in my
			library?<br/>
			Short answer: No. And there is nothing I can do about it, sorry.
		</p>
		<h2>Computation Time</h2>
		<p>
			Another question you could ask would be: So I have understood that you
			do a simple multiplication and addition for each of my tracks in my
			library. This seems pretty simple, it should be fast! How come the app
			takes forever to load the info I want?<br/>
			Yes, the computations are fast, indeed. However, Apple Events
			communication is not. It is actually really slow. Even more so since a
			few releases of macOS (somewhere around Sierra). Apple added a lot of
			security and privacy features to macOS, which is great! However, it
			also slowed the Apple Events inter-process communication.
		</p>
		<h2>Zero-Length Tracks</h2>
		<p>
			If you get a lot of tracks whose length is 0, you can hide them in the
			preferences. The change take effect at the next refresh.<br/>
			Usually these tracks are radio stations and other <i>live</i> tracks
			that are not correctly detected as non-real tracks and are thus
			displayed in the list of tracks.
		</p>
		<h2>UI Customization</h2>
		<p>
			In the window with the list of tracks, you can choose to show or hide
			the Artist, Album and Composer columns. Simply right-click the
			table-view header and choose the column you want to show or hide.
		</p>
		<h2>Refreshing the List of Tracks</h2>
		<p>
			If you want to get more up-to-date list of tracks and listen time after
			having listened to iTunes for a few hours, you can click the little
			arrow at the bottom left of the window.
